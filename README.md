## Installation

A compiler with C++ 17 support is required to successfully build SplineLib. Compilers that fulfill this requirement are GCC 7, GCC 8, clang 5, and clang 6. The project is tested with these compilers. Therefore, the master branch should always run with them.

To use SplineLib, you have to clone the github repository to your local machine.

	 $ git clone https://github.com/mfcats/SplineLib.git

For installation of all dependencies you can use spack.
For more information on how to install spack see: https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

After installing spack you need to add the SplineLib repository.

	 $ spack repo add path/to/SplineLib/scripts/spack-repo

After that you can install the SplineLib.

	 $ spack install splinelib

This will install the Google testing framework as dependency and afterwards SplineLib. Then, you can use SplineLib by running 

	$ spack load splinelib




## Installation for developers

If you wish to install the SplineLib for development use the following command:

	 $ spack setup splinelib@github

Now go to the SplineLib directory and create a build directory in which you can
build SplineLib with CMake and make.

	 $ mkdir build
	 $ cd build
	 $ ./spconfig.py ..

To verify that everything went right you can execute the built-in SplineLib tests.

	 $ ./test/SplineLibTests
